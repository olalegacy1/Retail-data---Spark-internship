# Retail-data---Spark-internship
I just completed my one-month Graduate Rotational Internship Program (GRIP) project, organized by The Sparks Foundation for the January section.
Function- Data Science and Business analytics
Tool used - Power BI
I did Exploratory data analysis (EDA) on sample store business data to gain insights that will drive business decisions and growth. Good data analytics helps the growth of an organization.
I created 5 dashboards.
Thanks to The Sparks Foundation for the opportunity.
All kinds of feedbacks and comments are welcomed. it will help me grow, improve, and be better.
